The Cry Baby by Kyle McKinley

Created for the "Not a Game Jam" game jam hosted on 
itch.io, this game is designed with the mindset of
"what makes a game a game". 

Based loosely on the cautionary tale by Heinrich Hoffman,
it removes all playability from a traditional game and
is without a true objective. 

Made with the Java programming language utilizing LWJGL 
for the OpenGL specification, the game was a means for
learning OpenGL concepts and practicing optimization. The 
game was never submitted as it was not finished by the 
deadline of the game jam.
